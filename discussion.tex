\chapter{Discussion}
\label{chapter:discussion}

In this chapter we'll discuss the findings, methods and such in a good
scientific manner.

At some point I want to discuss the analogue of software open source community
and how that works - how we should make people proud of making good, usable
datasets and sharing them.

\cite{DBLP:conf/hicss/HarsO01} is about the motivations behind working on open
source software - could be used for analogue for open data.

\cite{dorst2015frame} is the Kees Dorst book about reframing problems, which in
this case would be taking the technical problem of sharing reserch data, which
is not the actual problem, and reframing it as the problem on how to motivat
people to to share their data.
