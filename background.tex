\chapter{Background in scientific literature}
\label{chapter:background} 

Here is a look to the relevant papers and such - I will update this section once
I get to work with bibtex.

This section focuses on scientific literature.

\section{Research paper open access publishing}
\label{sec:benefits_open_publishing}

Open access refers to the online literature, research data and research papers in the
context of this thesis, that are free of charge for the reader of the
publication and openly available for reuse and redistribution
\cite{suber2007open, bailey2008open}. Research papers
have lived in the open access space for a much longer time than research data
and the research shows that publishing research papers openly correlates to
increased citations (ranging between 36\% - 172\% increase
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-cs-0606079, harnad2004comparing, eysenbach2006citation}).
Open access publishing of research papers make the
paper known and cited faster than non open access \cite{harnad2004comparing}.
The increase in citations to research papers is magnified in papers with lower
ranked journals, implying that open access publishing is a cost effective way
to increase the chance of making research impact
\cite{DBLP:journals/oir/XiaN12}.

There are different ways to do open access to research papers. One division is
the Golden Road and the Green Road, where the former refers to the journals
themselves publishing with open access and the latter to so called
self-archiving, where researchers publish their papers themselves \cite{harnad2004access}.
Self-archiving can be done on the research paper's author personal website,
a disciplinary archive or a institutional repository (either an institution
wide or smaller unit, a department for example) \cite{bailey2008open}. Aalto
University has an institutional repository for research papers and theses
produced in Aalto University\footnote{\url{https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/}}.

Open access publishing is growing in popularity. A study that explored the
growth of open access publishing between years 1993-2009 reported an annual
growth rate of 18\% in open access journals and 30\% increase in open access
articles, shown in Figure \ref{fig:oa_increase} \cite{laakso2011development}.
The study does not speculate on the reasons behind the growth of open access
publishing, but mentions the fact that nowadays many researchers use free
search engines such as Google Scholar\footnote{\url{https://scholar.google.fi/}} to
look for sources and that makes articles published openly to stand on equal
footing with other articles and they are more readily available. Open access
has also introduced the concept of open access mandate, which is a mandate or
a policy adopted by a university, research institution or research funder.
The open access mandate means that the researchers working under the mandate
are required to publish their research papers\footnote{\url{http://roarmap.eprints.org/}}.
The mandate likely has contributed to the increase in open access.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{centering}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/oa_increase}

    \caption{The growth of open access publishing between from 1993 to 2009 \cite{laakso2011development}}
    \label{fig:oa_increase}
\end{figure}

The total number of open access materials is hard to estimate nowadays, but the
Directory of Open Access Journals\footnote{\url{https://doaj.org/}} measures the
amount of open access journals world wide at 10 703 at the writing of this
thesis. The amount of open data journals and articles is growing faster than the amount
of more traditional, non open data journals \cite{laakso2011development}. This
is likely to correlate to the increased amount of open access mandates, since
mandatory open access rules imposed to the researchers correlate to a four
time increase in deposits to open access repositories
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SwanGHH15}.

It makes sense that open access publishing has become more popular. An usual
metric to measure the impact and relevance of a researchers is the h-index
\cite{DBLP:journals/scientometrics/Hirsch10}, which takes into account the
number of papers and the number of citations to those papers.

For further reference, we can recommend the work of Stevan Harnad as a good
starting point to open access literature. He is referenced in
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-cs-0606079, harnad2004comparing, harnad2004access}. If you are interested in data related to open access,
it is available both on the Directory of Open Access Journals as well as in a
public data repository about the growth of open
access\footnote{\url{http://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dvn/dv/dgoa}}.

\section{Research data open access publishing}
\label{sec:research_data_oa}

The idea to make research data openly accessible has been around for a long
time. As early as 1985 policies and practices to share research data to further
research and prevent fraud were developed \cite{fienberg1985sharing}.
The Internet and the emergence of data intensive science have changed the the
possibilities and quantities of research data. Research Data Alliance (RDA)
has been founded in 2013 to address the growing need of research data
publishing and sharing infrastructure
\cite{DBLP:journals/dlib/BermanWW14, DBLP:books/ms/4paradigm09}. Despite this,
research data open access publishing is far from research paper open access
publishing. Metrics, such as the h-index
\cite{DBLP:journals/scientometrics/Hirsch10}, do not exist either for research
data nor is research data publication accounted for in the h-index.

Research papers should be self-contained in the sense that a if you know the
area of research, you can read the research paper and understand it's main
points and findings. Research papers often contain the processed results of the research data
behind them as well. Research data, however, is rarely self contained and
requires metadata to be useful for re use. It is also worth noting that datasets
nowadays will not be used solely by people who are experts in the fields that
the research data originated from nor will people work in geographically in the
same locations anymore which makes metadata even more crucial for reusing the
data \cite{DBLP:journals/jbi/HarrisTTPGC09, DBLP:journals/jasis/Borgman12}.

While research papers generally follow an established structure and can easily
be published online in a PDF format, research data comes in many different
forms and flavors. For example, phylogenetic trees used in evolution
research look nothing like the brain images gathered in neuroimaging
research. This imposes a technical challenge to the solutions that
could be used to share research data - file formats are different, the
file size may be range anywhere from few hundred kilobytes to multiple
terabytes and because many fields do not share common practices on how to
manage their research data even seemingly similar datasets might be
incompatible between researchers
\cite{whitlock2011data, DBLP:journals/fini/PolineBGGHHHHKMPSAK12}.

As such, research data open access and publication is not prevalent in many
fields of science. The practices of data sharing vary a lot between fields and
even inside disciplines \cite{DBLP:journals/jasis/Borgman12, cragin2010data}.
This takes place even while all fields of science are
becoming more and more data intensive and many fields, such as psychology,
could reap great benefits from sharing research data
\cite{DBLP:books/ms/4paradigm09, wicherts2006poor}. The following
Sections \ref{sec:research_data_challenges} and \ref{sec:research_data_benefits}
delve deeper into the benefits and challenges of sharing research data by
publishing it with the open access paradigm. A paper by P Arzberger et
al.{\ }\cite{DBLP:journals/datascience/ArzbergerSBBCLMUW04} summarizes these
challenges and benefits in an organizational level. A paper by Jean-Baptiste
Poline et al.{\ }describes the situation of data sharing in the field of
neuroimaging research in good depth and the discussion in the paper is also
applicable to other fields of science
\cite{DBLP:journals/fini/PolineBGGHHHHKMPSAK12}.

A Chinese group of researchers conducted an experiment where they measured the
efficiency of Chinese national data sharing platforms. Their findings are
listed below \cite{DBLP:journals/lht/SiLZXHLX15} (TODO: this does not probably
live here):

\begin{itemize}
    \item The policies governing data sharing need to be improved.
    \item Metadata is poorly used.
    \item The whole datasets are not available and datasets are not in fact
          openly available but require permissions.
    \item The platforms do not offer all the necessary services related to
          research data sharing, such as data collection.
    \item The research efficiency of the platforms is low.
\end{itemize}

Peer reviewing, which is at the heart of making sure that research papers
and thus research is valid, is yet to be fully introduced to the process of
publishing research data. One study piloted a process of reviewing datasets
the researchers had used \cite{DBLP:journals/ijdc/GrootveldE12}. The study found
that many researchers indeed found datasets useful for their research and that
the amount of people that responded to their online questionnaire was 573,
15.8\% of the people who the survey was sent to. They are continuing to develop
the review system, focusing on especially how and when to ask reviews from the
dataset consumers in order to minimize the bother to the user.

\section{Challenges of sharing research data}
\label{sec:research_data_challenges}

Sharing research data poses many challenges, some of them organizational and
managerial while others have to do with the nature of research data and the
culture surrounding them. The challenges are presented in more detail below
\cite{DBLP:journals/datascience/ArzbergerSBBCLMUW04, tenopir2011data}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Technological issues - there is a lack of infrastructure to
          effectively publish and share research data.
    \item Institutional and managerial issues - the principles of open access
          require tailoring for institutions, since datasets, research funding
          and similar matters require local management.
    \item Financial issues - managing research data archiving and publishing
          infrastructure requires continuous financial investment beyond the
          scope of implementation and publication of the research projects
          results.
    \item Legal and policy issues - national and international law set
          limitations to sharing research data.
    \item Cultural and behavioural issues - in the end, research data sharing
          comes down to the actions of the researchers generating the research
          data and if the culture for it does not exist and the behaviour is
          not encouraged, there will be no sharing of research data.
\end{itemize}

These issues are highlighted in the questionnaire responses in
\cite{tenopir2011data} for reasons for not making their data not accessible
to public, shown in Table \ref{table:reasons_not_sharing}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Reasons for not sharing research data, questionnaire with 1329
    respondents \cite{tenopir2011data}}:
    \label{table:reasons_not_sharing}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}

      \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Tenopir paper \cite{tenopir2011data} contains many more useful tables,
showing for example, that many researchers (56.1\%) either do not know or do not have
metadata standards for their research data and data comes in many different
categories without even going to the specifics in the fields of science.

Research data may be serious privacy concern especially in fields such as
genomics or health care related research where research data could be connected
to the participants of the study. There is a tension between sharing relevant
and good quality data and protecting the privacy of the participants - more
detailed data provides for a more rich research, but allows for an easier
connection on to the participants \cite{kaye2012tension}. Work is being done
to facilitate safe and accurate sharing of data with privacy concerns. Both
codes of conduct and technological solutions are required, especially since the
data will outlive the participants of the study and the privacy must be
preserved for the entirety of the data's lifetime
\cite{DBLP:journals/jam/NohCJ14a, knoppers2011towards}.

A more implementation level problem to sharing research data is the fact that
due to the legal issues or maybe the desire to work on your data before
publishing it means that research data should be able the be shared more
locally in addition to being open to the whole world. In practice, this means
that there should be means to provide access to the research data to
collaborating researchers or people within the research organization you are
working in to enable collaboration \cite{DBLP:journals/libt/Witt08}.

\iffalse
\subsection{Research data is diverse}

While research papers generally follow a
strict structure and can easily be published in a PDF format, research data
comes in all forms and flavors. For example, research data from a brain imaging
study will look completely different from a dataset that originates from
sociological research (citation). Not only the shape of the data is different,
the size of datasets can vary from the few megabyte survey results to the
multiple petabyte simulation results from a particle collider.

Even when you get down to practicalities the diversity of research data offers
challenges - results generated from one software might be binary incompatible
with another software within one field of science. And even if you were using
the same software, our versions might be different or you might do things in
such a different way that you are not compatible with other working on the
same field.

\subsection{Research data requires metadata}

Metadata refers to data about data. It is a description of the data and entails
details such as when was the dataset collected, what kind of equipment was
used or if there was something noteworthy in how the experiment was run
(citation). Due to the diversity of data in different fields, the metadata
differs between fields as well (citation). Some standards for metadata exist,
but not an all fields of science (citation).

Research data in and on itself is the most important thing to be published, but
working on someone else's research data without the relevant metadata adds
another layer of complexity and might mean that you cannot use the data at all
(citation). One reason to publish your data is to make reproduction of you work
(citation) easier, and without proper metadata it is hard or impossible to
do that.

\subsection{Research data might be a privacy issue}

In many fields of science (health care, telecommunication to name a few) the
privacy of the participants to the studies is essential. If you go about
publishing your data, you need to be conscious about maintaining the anonymity
of the people taking part in your research (citation).

\subsection{Research data might be published locally}

Due to privacy issues or maybe funding issues it might be so that the data
that is used in research cannot be published to the world but maybe you can
publish it within your organization or upon request. This sets access rights
requirements to your dataset, so while you might be able to openly publish
your metadata in order to tell the world that your dataset exists, your dataset
should not be available for everyone (citation). 

\subsection{Research data requires support from higher ups and related partners}

Individuals can publish their data any way they wish as long as it is within
legal boundaries. However, if institutions such as universities or libraries
wish to venture into publishing their research, individual researchers and
people working with the data need support from their organizations. Studies
have shown (citation) that organizations need to commit to the idea of open
access publishing in order for it to work.

\fi

\section{Benefits of publishing research data}
\label{sec:research_data_benefits}

When talking about the benefits of publishing and sharing research data two big
points are generally made. Firstly it is thought that publishing and sharing
research data pushes science forward by enabling more people to work on the
data and subsequently accelerate the process of making relevant discoveries.
It is also not to be forgotten that reproducibility is one of the founding
pillars of scientific process and reproducing others' work without access
to their data is very hard \cite{jasny2011again}.
Secondly it is thought that the publishing of research data makes your
research papers better, giving them credibility and yielding more citations in
the process. There are more subtle benefits as well that are discussed later
in this section.

Publishing research data benefits different stakeholders involved in the
data publishing game, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:beneficaries}. The figure
also lays out how the rationales of sharing research data affect the different
stakeholder groups \cite{DBLP:journals/jasis/Borgman12}.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{centering}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/beneficaries}
    \end{centering}
    \caption{The different beneficiaries and rationales of data sharing \cite{DBLP:journals/jasis/Borgman12}}
    \label{fig:beneficaries}
\end{figure}

Publishing research data furthers science by allowing new people to ask new
questions of the existing data \cite{whitlock2011data}, allowing for better
reproducability \cite{jasny2011again} and straight up widening the scope and
depth of the research in question \cite{DBLP:journals/see/FischerZ10}.
By making data publicly available the developers and people not included in the
scientific community, such as political decision makers, can also benefit from
the data being generated in the different fields of research
\cite{DBLP:journals/jasis/Borgman12}.

One can take a different view on the matter of sharing research data as well -
if one's results are strong and backed up by evidence, there should not be a
barrier (other than the work related to the publishing and he possible legal
issues) to publish one's data. A reason to not make data openly accessible is
the fear of reanalysis and that people might find errors in your research. This
was examined in a study in the field of psychology
\cite{wicherts2011willingness}. The findings of the study were that it was
indeed so that research papers not publishing their data had weaker results.
The comparison of amounts of errors is shown in Figure \ref{fig:errors}. In order
to avoid this phenomenon better policies of sharing data are needed which would
in turn make the quality of research better.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{centering}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/reporting_errors}
    \end{centering}
    \caption{The difference in reporting errors between research papers with not public and public research data \cite{wicherts2011willingness}}
    \label{fig:errors}
\end{figure}

In order to get research data published and openly accessible the researchers
generating the data need to put it to the public domain. The benefits of
sharing, however, are more clear to the consumers of the published data and
preparing data for publication requires work from the person publishing the
data. Traditionally academic credit and credibility has been tied to the number
of articles published and citations of those articles and public data does not
play a role in that. However, publishing datasets can have a positive impact on
research papers' citation rate bringing the associate credit with it
\cite{piwowar2007sharing}.

A study about cancer microarray clinical publications it was found out that
research papers that had their research data publisher received a 69\%
increase in citation rate. In the same study the 48\% of the research papers
that had the associated research data included received 85\% of the aggregate
citations \cite{piwowar2007sharing}.

In addition to providing value to the researchers publishing their papers in
the form of citations, one study \cite{piwowar2011data} study suggests that
the investment to a data repository gives a generous return of investment to
the institution building and using the repository as well. The study makes a
comparison of spent money - 400 000 dollars in original research resulted in
16 papers, whereas the cost of running a data repository of biological research
data sets for a year would cost the same 400 000 dollars but contribute more
than 1000 papers within the following four years.

Making research data openly accessible lessens the risk of data fraud taking
place. Data fraud, which constitutes acts such as using fictitious data or
tampering with the data in order to support your conclusions, could be
prevented or made more difficult by sharing all research data. This matter is
discussed in a paper by Peter Doorn et al.{\ }\cite{DBLP:journals/ijdc/DoornDH13}
following a series of incidents where fraudulent research data was used as a
basis for research.

\iffalse

The benefits of research data publishing are not as straightforward as
publishing papers. Academic credit is distributed by the number of papers you
publish and by the number of citations you get to those papers. Research data
is often viewed as the fuel to the research. The actual downsides, from the
research, are covered in the next section (forward reference).

\subsection{Publishing research data yields more citations}

One of the most direct upsides of publishing research data is that it seems to
increase the citation count of the paper where the published data was related
to (citation). The research on this has not been done on all fields of science,
but the numbers from the fields it has been conducted (medical science and
some others, put them down here at a later date) are impressive - up to
69\% (citation) increase in citation rates.

\subsection{Publishing research data makes your research reach more people}

While being quite intuitive, it is worth mentioning that open publishing of
research data results in your research being exposed to a larger audience
(citation).

\subsection{Publishing research data grows the impact of your research}

The impact of one's research is hard to quantify, but exposing more people to
your research and at the same time promoting your research papers enables your
research find places where it can make difference in the world (citation).
(this small section requires more meat on the bones)

\subsection{Publishing research data makes your research better quality}

The scientific principles require all scientific work to be replicateable. It
is quite hard to replicate your results just based on your paper, especially if
your paper is heavy on analysis dependant on your data (citations). In this
light publishing your research data in fact makes your research better quality.

Publishing research data should make all research data better as well. The
logic behind this is that if all research data was public, it would fall under
public scrutiny making it harder to publish fraudulent results and it would
force the authors of the data to make it more readable to the wider audience
(citation).

\subsection{Publishing research data can save you from fraud accusations}

In addition to preventing fraud from others, if your data is public you could
easily deal with fraud accusations by pointing people to your public data and
the analysis that was performed on that data (citation).

\section{The disadvantages of publishing research data}

There are a few strikes against publishing research data. Some of the
disadvantages are more perceived than real, but they prevent the publication
of research data just as well.

\subsection{Preparing research data requires work}

As mentioned in section (reference backwards), publishing research data
requires metadata. Metadata entails good documentation as well as annotated
datasets and such that are not necessarily required during the research
project. Time taken away from researchers core work is a hindrance in their
daily work (citation).

This problem is made bigger by the fact that there are no best practices or
widely adopted tools to manage your data during your research process and
finally publish your data (citation).

\subsection{Publishing research data adds costs to the publication process}

Publishing is not free from the financial standpoint either. Since scientists
are not metadata experts nor are they experts in electronic publishing, other
facets of the research institution. Open publishing of research data requires
curators for the data (for example, from a library) and administrators for the
system that manage the research data (citation). While these groups may have
communicated in the past to some extent, publishing research data is an effort
that requires a new kind of communication and collaboration within these groups
(citation).

\fi

\section[Validity of the benefit research]{Research on the validity of increased citation rate with publishing
research data}

While many research papers imply a causation between publishing research papers
in an open access way, there are studies that take this claim critically and
examine whether there are other causes that would explain the perceived
citation advantage that open access brings. In one study
\cite{DBLP:journals/joi/CraigPMPA07} the research methods of studies that show
the increased citation rate with open access publishing do not take all the
matters that go into citation analysis into account and proposes that more
sophisticated and rigorous statistical analysis to prove the causation would
be required.

Another study notes that open access research papers get more downloads and
readers, but no more citations. The citation advantage might be an artifact
of other causes or caused by uncontrolled experiments \cite{davis2008open}.

While these studies are fewer than the ones pointing to the increased citation
rate in open access publishing, it is important to note that citation analysis
is not a simple manner and the methods to show the benefits of open access
publishing should be carefully designed.

\iffalse
There is also research that suggests that the increased citation rate shown in
studies is actually a statistical artifact and that research data publication
would not have a direct correlation to the increased citation rate (citations).
There are not many of these papers, but their existence suggests that there
should be more critical studies to validate the benefits of open data
publishing. On the other hand, the amount of research data being published
is quite small compared to all data that is being generated (citation), so
when more data becomes available this kind of analysis also becomes more
valuable and accurate.
\fi

\section{Different ways of sharing research data}

Openly publishing and sharing research data takes place on different levels of
organizations. The general ways to publish openly are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Institutional data repositories, discussed in \cite{cragin2010data}.
    \item Disciplinary repositories, example in \cite{DBLP:journals/nar/EdgarDL03}.
    \item International repositories, example in \cite{2013EGUGA..15.7202L}.
    \item National repositories, example in \cite{cimino2010clinical}.
\end{itemize}

A more practical look into the different implementations to these as well as
some practical benchmarking will be presented in Section \ref{sec:benchmarking}.

\subsection{Requirements for data sharing}

Many funding bodies require researchers to publish research data in addition
to the actual papers. The research shows, however, that even though publishing
research data is required, it is not being done in practice (citation). Even
papers that are considered high impact and fields that would benefit the most
from sharing data (such as psychology) do not share their research data
(citation).

\fi

\section{Adherence to data publishing requirements}

Many funding bodies and journals require the publication of research data
related to the research papers. Adherence to this requirement has been studied
and the results are that despite the demand for sharing research data it is not
being shared commonly. In one study 10 datasets were requested from a journal
that explicitly requests sharing datasets and only one dataset was received
\cite{savage2009empirical}. In a bigger study the authors were able to gain
63 datasets out of 249 possible datasets from a journal that also requires
datasets to be shared for reanalysis \cite{wicherts2006poor}. In a study of
500 hundred papers, of which 149 were not subject to any research data
publishing requirements, only 47 papers had submitted the complete raw data
online. Of the 149 who were not required to do publish research data did not
publish anything \cite{alsheikh2011public}. The 500 hundred papers in the last
study were selected from 50 different journals by selecting the 10 research
papers with the highest impact factor.

The reasons behind not sharing data were different. In the smallest study \cite{savage2009empirical},
where the researchers were able to contact the people who refused the reasons
for not sharing are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two email addresses listed on the original research paper were no
          longer valid and once one of them was reached she was on maternity
          leave and could not help.
    \item Two of those who did not share did not give a reason for not sharing - on further
          inquiry one of them responded that he was not aware of the research
          data publishing requirements.
    \item One stated that he was too busy and compiling the research data
          would be too much work.
    \item One had changed institutions and no longer had jurisdiction over the
          data and the people in the publishing institution responded that
          sharing would have been too much work.
    \item Three did not answer the inquiry at all at first - on further inquiry
          one of them replied that he was in favor of sharing data in general
          but wanted to conduct more research on the research data himself
          first.
\end{itemize}

In the biggest study the authors postulated that factors such as the 6-12
months between the publishing of the papers and the authors' investigation
the research data publication policies might have changed, though this is noted
to be unlikely \cite{alsheikh2011public}.

\section{Sharing research workflows}

Since reproduction of results is a big draw towards sharing research data
sharing research workflows has been a subject of research.As an example, you
could have a look at my\({}_{\mbox{Experiment}}\)\footnote{\url{http://www.myexperiment.org/home}}
or Galaxy\footnote{\url{https://galaxyproject.org/}}.
The former is a holistic approach to allow researchers from all
fields to share workflows, whereas the latter focuses on the field of genomics.
This approach promotes the transparency of science and enables
easier reproduction of data. From the scientific literature side you can take
a look at \cite{goecks2010galaxy, DBLP:journals/fgcs/RoureGS09}.

Along with sharing research workflows the idea of executable papers has been
thrown around.\footnote{\url{http://www.executablepapers.com/}} The idea of
executable papers is to provide a platform where along with the research paper
some way to execute relevant objects to the paper are included. Relevant
objects might include plotting graphs or trying theorems proposed in the
research paper with different outputs. Some of the solutions to also allow
the viewing of primary research data
\cite{DBLP:journals/procedia/GorpM11, DBLP:journals/procedia/NowakowskiCHKKBMDM11}.
The main goal of executable papers is to allow the results of the research
paper to replicated easily.

\iffalse

In addition to sharing research data, research has been done in sharing
research workflows. Sharing research data workflows makes replicating
experiments and sharing results even easier. Sharing workflows is common in
fields where collecting data and doing analysis are easy to automate end to
end, such as genomics (citations). This thesis does not focus sharing research
data workflows, but using making the process behind the results more visible
should make scientific work better. 

\fi

\section{Sharing Big Data}

The focus of this thesis and the discussion in this literature review has been
in the traditional research data, but Big Data is becoming more prominent in
all fields of science. Managing Big Data adds more complexity to the data
management processes and infrastructure
\cite{DBLP:conf/cloudcom/DemchenkoZGWL12}. Sharing Big Data is also a wholly
different concept than sharing more traditional data, since you cannot download
Big Data datasets on your personal computer. The problem becomes more about
access controls and providing a secure infrastructure to access the Big Data
when collaboration and publication of Big Data is concerned.

An interesting twist to the sharing research workflows and Big Data is the
Hadoop plug-in for Galaxy, which allows Big Data computation to be integrated
to the genomics research workflows \cite{DBLP:conf/bcb/PiredduLSZ14}.

\iffalse
Big Data is generally defined by the three Vs - volume, velocity and variety.
Volume refers to the amount of data - there are not usually set in stone
metrics for the volume, but as rule of thumb one should consider a warehouse
full of computers as one computing unit when it comes down to big data.
Velocity means the speed that data is being gathered. Variety in the context
of big data refers to the fact that since big data usually comes from a variety
of sources, also the content and the format of the data varies. (citations)

Nowadays big data has an added V in veracity, which means the uncertainty of
the data. In the case of big data it is impossible to tell how much of your data
is reliable, since you typically do not do validation or vetting of our data.
(citations)

All big data instances do not of course contain all of the Vs. Big Data as a
concept is rather fuzzily defined, but all big data systems contain some of the
traits described above.

In this context sharing big research data adds additional challenges, since 
you can not simply download big data research files to your computer. Some
research has gone to sharing big data datasets (cite), but since there is a lot
of work left to make "small" data sharing and management work this thesis
focuses on more traditional research data sharing.

\fi

\section{Research data curation}

Publishing and sharing research data requires work that is all away from the
researchers other research work. Moreover, after the research data has been published
it no longer concerns the researcher, but someone has to look after it.
University libraries have already assumed the role of curating digitally
published research papers and it would make sense for them to be included in
the process of research data publication and archival as the curation and
archival experts  \cite{hjorland2014curating, heidorn2011emerging}. The
sharp increase in the amounts of data as well as the growing digitalization of
research output is going to force libraries to find their role as well as
researchers to find a way to collaborate with the data management experts to
make the research data publication and archival as successful as possible.

\section{Implementations in literature}
\label{sec:implementations_literature}

Some of the technical solutions for research data management (including
management during the research projects and publishing data) have been
documented in scientific literature. They are presented here and a more
practical look into some of them is presented in section
\ref{sec:benchmarking}.

iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) is open source software designed
for research organizations to manage their research data. iRODS virtualizes the
storage hardware and offers a programmable rules system to enable automatic
data management. For more information, see their website\footnote{\url{http://irods.org/}} and
the book about it from \cite{DBLP:series/synthesis/2010Rajasekar}.

CKAN, an open source data publishing platform, is a tool that can be used to
publish digital research data. It can be found online\footnote{\url{http://ckan.org/}} and
a paper describing it in use in a academic context can be found in
\cite{winn2013open}. The article found the CKAN system to be robust open source
software suitable for publishing research data but not managing the research
data lifecycle.

Dataverse is an open source data repository software solution which you can
find online\footnote{\url{http://dataverse.org/}}. Similarly to CKAN, Dataverse
focuses on publishing research data but has more emphasis on getting
citations on the data and making it that way more comparable to publishing
research papers. You can read the background from \cite{king2007introduction}.

The Hydra Project\footnote{\url{http://projecthydra.org/}} is another open
source repository solution. What differentiates Hydra from the previous
implementations is that it is quite flexible - the user can define all the data
models and the content types that go into the repository. A research paper
about the system is at \cite{awre2009project}.

\section{Linked data}

We could throw in here a section about linked data (and semantic web stuff,
since that has to do with online datasets. For more info, check out
\url{http://www.ldf.fi/index.html} and \url{http://linkeddata.org/}.

\section{Interesting research data related literature}

\section{General points}

Points to touch on this section:

\begin{itemize}
    \item sharing data and open publishing of results has been studied
    \item generally it is noted that sharing papers online leads to benefits
    \begin{itemize}
        \item citation rate increases
        \item impact of your research grows
        \item you reach wider audience
    \end{itemize}
    \item some research contradicts the increase in citation (comparing open
          access and closed citation), claiming that the increased citation
          rate of open access things is a statistical artifact
    \item in addition, there are papers on how you should organize your data
          sharing ways
    \item funding bodies have started demanding the publication of data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item however, people who have published in papers that require you
              to publish data do not actually do that
        \item publishing data is rare even on fields where sharing would be
              great
    \end{itemize}
    \item privacy and security is a concern
    \item present some systems available
    \item some technologies and platforms could be mentioned
    \begin{itemize}
        \item iRODS
        \item CKAN
