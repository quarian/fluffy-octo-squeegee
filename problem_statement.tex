\chapter{Problem Statement}
\label{chapter:problem}

This is a chapter where we rigoriously define the problem statement.

Here is the problem background:

\begin{itemize}
    \item there is a growing demand on making research data public for other
          scientist and the public
    \item demand from funding agencies and open access community
    \item also scientific principles - how are you going to replicate others'
          work without the same datasets?
    \item furthering science
    \item these points need to be made concise and be backed up with literature
\end{itemize}

And here is what practical problems it will pose:

\begin{itemize}
    \item no infrastructure
    \item no know-how
    \item no culture
    \item there is demand, but there are no repercussions for not sharing the
          data
    \item many datasets are not suitable for publishing as is
\end{itemize}
