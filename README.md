Aalto Master's Thesis Template
=====

- Adapted from the one found here: https://into.aalto.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6301918

- Remember to check the school, degree programme, major, city (campus), ... etc in the main file as well as in `aalto-thesis.sty` to ensure that they match your situation.

Note
-----

- On CSE workstations and with TeX Live, you may need to install `texlive-lang-finnish` and `texlive-lang-swedish` to make language selection in `aaltologo` package work properly.
