\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter:conclusions}

This thesis has examined different technical solutions to managing, sharing and
publishing research data, focusing on sharing and publishing. The Table
\ref{table:solutions} shows the features of solutions presented and shows
how they differ in the context of research data publishing, whereas Table
\ref{table:management} shows the same solutions but in the context of research
data management during a research project. The Table
\ref{table:legend_colors} shows the legend that is used in Tables
\ref{table:solutions} and \ref{table:management}.

    \hline
    \textbf{Color and Mark} & \textbf{Meaning} \\
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\cellcolor{green}++} & The feature is well implemented and could be considered a strong point
                          in the solution \\
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\cellcolor{yellow}+} & The feature is implemented in the solutions in some way - it might need
                          some work to get up and running or the other features of the system can be used to
                          approximate the functionality \\
    \hline
    \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\cellcolor{red}-}    & The feature is missing from the solution or can be found from the system but according
                          to user feedback is too hard to use and is a clear weak point of the system \\
    \hline

In Tables \ref{table:solutions} and \ref{table:management} the IDA, Etsin, Avaa and PAS are a part of the
Finnish Open Science Initiative. Dataverse, Hydra, Zenodo, iRODS and CKAN are
open source solutions. EUDAT refers to the B2-offering\footnote{\url{http://eudat.eu/}},
of which the B2Share and B2Drop are considered to be a part of a reserch
data management and publication process. ACRIS is the Elsevier Pure instance
that is being trialed at Aalto University. GitHub is included in the
comparasion since it is a widely adopted tool for publishing and collaborating
on software projects.

The features used in the columns in Table \ref{table:solutions} are explained
below in Table \ref{table:solution_features}:


\label{table:solution_features}
\captionof{table}{The features being compared on Table \ref{table:solutions}}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| >{\raggedright}p{3cm} | X |}
    \hline
    \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Explanation} \\
    \hline
    Data Storage    & Data storage means that the solution offers the chance to
                      save the actual research data to the system and not just links
                      to the datasets, for example\\
    \hline
    Metadata Storage &  Metadata storage means that the system has a structured way
                        of storing metadata anout datasets - this does not mean that
                        the system should contain actual research data, since some services
                        are built just as places to store metadata and point to datasets\\
    \hline
    Open Access Data    & System that implements this feature allows the datasets to be searched
                          and downloaded by the general public without restrictions to the use
                          of the datasets\\
    \hline
    Restricted Data    & Whereas open access data is available for all the world to see, systems
                         that implement the restriced data feature allow for a more fine grained
                         user management allowing datasets to be shared for restricted groups
                         of users\\
    \hline
    Long Term Archival    & Long term archival is archival for datasets that lasts for tens of years -
                            a lot longer than commodity hard drives last in active use (commodity
                            hard drives usually last from three to five years in active use)\\
    \hline
    Full Text Search    & Full text search refers to the ability to search the all the metadata
                          available in the system to find relevant datasets\\
    \hline
    Dataset Versionig    & Dataset versioning means that the system allows for uploading newer versions
                           of the already uploaded datasets without deleting the old datasets, since
                           someone might use and refer to the old datasets\\
    \hline
    Identifier Scheme    & Identifier scheme tells which, if any, persistent identifier schemese the
                           solution implements\\
    \hline
\end{tabularx}

Notable in the table is that the existing solutions to research data publishing
do not take into account the long term storage of research data. The one
solution that does that, PAS, only focuses on that making it imperative that
the systems that are used to publish the research data should be integrated to
a system that provides long term archival as well. The open source tools offer
a notably similar set of features and any one of them could be taken into use
and it would serve as a serviceable technical platform for research data
publishing.

The identifier scheme is also a point of interest. Citing datasets is something
that has not been widely adopted, which means that in order to help that
adoption a well known identifier scheme should be used.

The same tools that are suitable for research data publishing are not
necessarily right for research data management and vice versa. Technical
point solutions for both exist, but a solution that takes care of the whole
lifecycle of the data is what is needed.

This thesis has also identified many aspects of a solution that could solve the
research data management and sharing problem. These requirements are split
into functional, hardware and experiental requirements and are shown below
in Tables (TODO: put tables here). The presented requirements could be used
to design a research data management and publishing solution as well as to
validate an existing solution.

(REQUIREMENT TABLES HERE)

Technical solutions alone are not enough to make research data management
and publishing a reality. The culture about open research data has to be
changed so that it is natural and rewarding for people to publish and take
good care of their research data. This requires training, commitment from
research institutions and people to advocate for the cause.
