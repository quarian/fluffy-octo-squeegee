\chapter{Prototype Solution}
\label{chapter:prototype}

In this chapter we'll explain the prototype solution. Prototype is one outcome
of the thesis, but so should be the insight generated by the user testing.

\section{System description}
\label{sec:system_description}

Here we'll describe the system with the softwarae stack and relevant things.

\section{System testing}
\label{sec:system_testing}

Prototypes are naturally worthless without testing with users. Once we have a
system up and running, we'll gather notes and such to have things to say here.

\section{Outcomes of the prototype}
\label{sec:prototype_outcomes}
